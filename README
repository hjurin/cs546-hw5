This repository contains all the source code for parallelizing the normalization of a matrix A.
It also contains all tests and tests results.
All files are described at the bottom of this README.

# BUILD AND RUN

A Makefile has been implemented with following commands:
    (default)       build all solutions (including serial)
    mrproper        delete all executables, parasite files and test results
    test            runs solutions over different sized matrix and blocks
                    and store their result elapsed times in elapsed_times.csv


# FILES DESCRIPTION

In all files, print_time() has been added.
It outputs the elapsed time into the csv file.

* matrixNorm                It is the original source code.
* matrixNorm(i)             CUDA solutions
* test_plotting.ipynb       Contains the jupyter-notebook for plotting elapsed times
* Contents                  Contains the plots of elapsed times
* genuine_elapsed_times.csv The used csv file. It will not be erased if you run tests.
